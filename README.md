# ExploreJH

I undertook a freelancing opportunity for a renowned travel vlogger and influencer based in Ranchi, Jharkhand.
The goal of this project was to develop a dynamic travel planning website that was specifically designed for Jharkhand.

I created and developed a user-friendly interface with sections devoted to exploring areas and exhibiting well-known locations using a stack of
React, and JavaScript. I also included extra services like recommendations for restaurants, travel deals, and vehicle rentals.
